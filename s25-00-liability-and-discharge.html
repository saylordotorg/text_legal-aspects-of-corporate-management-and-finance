            <li>The liability of an agent who signs commercial paper</li>
            <li>What contract liability is imposed when a person signs commercial paper</li>
            <li>What warranty liability is imposed upon a transferor</li>
            <li>What happens if there is payment or acceptance by mistake</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch25_p02">In <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch22#mayer_1.0-ch22">Chapter 19 "Nature and Form of Commercial Paper"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch23#mayer_1.0-ch23">Chapter 20 "Negotiation of Commercial Paper"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch24#mayer_1.0-ch24">Chapter 21 "Holder in Due Course and Defenses"</a>, we focused on the methods and consequences of negotiating commercial paper when all the proper steps are followed. For example, a maker gives a negotiable note to a payee, who properly negotiates the paper to a third-party holder in due course. As a result, this third party is entitled to collect from the maker, unless the latter has a real defense.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch25_p03">In this chapter, we begin by examining a question especially important to management: personal liability for signing company notes and checks. Then we look at the two general types of liability—contract and warranty—introduced in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch23#mayer_1.0-ch23">Chapter 20 "Negotiation of Commercial Paper"</a>. We conclude the chapter by reviewing the ways in which parties are discharged from liability.</p>
